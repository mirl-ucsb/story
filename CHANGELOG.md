# Changelog

All notable changes to Telar will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.1-beta] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- **Critical thumbnail loading bug**: Fixed thumbnails not displaying on objects page due to empty string handling in Liquid templates. Objects with empty `thumbnail` or `iiif_manifest` values now properly fall through to appropriate fallback logic.
- **Local image viewer bug**: Fixed local images (self-hosted IIIF) not loading in object detail pages due to empty `iiif_manifest` string being treated as truthy in Liquid conditionals.
- **Objects gallery thumbnails**: Fixed local image thumbnails not loading in objects gallery by adding non-empty string checks to all `iiif_manifest` conditionals.

## [0.3.0-beta] - 2025-10-25

### Added

- **Google Sheets integration**: Config-based workflow supporting both GitHub Pages and local development. Users paste shared and published URLs into `_config.yml` for automatic GID discovery and CSV fetching. No GitHub Secrets required.
  - `fetch_google_sheets.py` script for local CSV fetching
  - `discover_sheet_gids.py` for automatic tab GID discovery from published sheets
  - Excel template with demo data at `docs/google_sheets_integration/telar-template.xlsx`
  - Google Sheets Template available and can easily be duplicated, at https://bit.ly/telar-template
  - Local development guide at `docs/google_sheets_integration/README.md`
  - **Instruction rows and columns**: Add notes and instructions directly in Google Sheets or CSVs that are automatically filtered out during processing
    - Rows starting with `#` are skipped (useful for section breaks, TODOs, and temporary comments)
    - Columns with names starting with `#` (e.g., `# Instructions`, `# Notes`) are ignored during JSON conversion
    - Template includes `# Instructions` column with examples for user guidance
- **Comprehensive error messaging system**: User-friendly warnings displayed on index, objects, and story pages when configuration issues are detected
- **Object ID validation**: Automatic stripping of file extensions from object IDs and warnings for spaces in filenames
- **IIIF manifest validation**: Full validation of external IIIF manifests with detailed error messages
- **Thumbnail validation**: Automatic detection and clearing of invalid thumbnail values (placeholders, non-image files)
- **Build-time warnings**: Console logging with structured [INFO] and [WARN] messages during CSV to JSON conversion
- **Index page issue summary**: Context-aware warnings that link directly to affected objects or stories
- **Objects gallery warnings**: Summary of all objects with configuration issues with links to details
- **Story intro warnings**: Display of configuration issues before users scroll, preventing confusion
- **Panel error handling**: JavaScript-based detection and display of missing images in panel content
- **IIIF manifest copy button**: Object pages now display the full IIIF manifest URL in a copyable code box with one-click copy functionality
- **Individual coordinate copy buttons**: Each coordinate (X, Y, Zoom) in the coordinate identification panel now has its own copy button for quick copying of individual values
- **Theme system**: Flexible theming system with 4 preset themes and support for custom themes
  - Preset themes: Paisajes Coloniales (default), Neogranadina, Santa Barbara, and Austin
  - Easy theme switching via `_config.yml` with single-line configuration
  - Customizable colors (primary, secondary, panel backgrounds) and fonts (headings, body)
  - Advanced users can create `_data/themes/custom.yml` for fully custom themes (gitignored by default)
  - Dynamic CSS generation using SCSS with Liquid templating

### Fixed

- **Orphaned file cleanup**: generate_collections.py now properly removes old files before generating new ones, preventing stale content

### Changed

- **Default content management**: Google Sheets is now the recommended default workflow, with CSV files as an optional alternative for users who prefer direct file editing
- **Error message clarity**: All user-facing errors reference "configuration CSV or Google Sheet" for clarity
- **Object warning field**: Added object_warning to Jekyll collection frontmatter for template access
- **Objects CSV column order**: Moved iiif_manifest to position 4 (after description) for better visibility and logical grouping
- **Story CSV column order**: Reordered columns to group related fields - object and coordinates (x, y, zoom) now appear at start after step number, followed by question/answer, then panel configuration
- **Story intro layout**: Intro slide now appears in the narrative column (left side) instead of full-screen, with step 1's viewer visible immediately on the right for a cleaner, more consistent experience
- **Glossary page styling**: Glossary term links now use theme link colors and body font for consistent theming
- **Glossary navigation**: Clicking glossary terms on the glossary index page now opens a slide-over panel instead of navigating to separate pages, providing a smoother browsing experience
  - Panels slide away and then back in when switching between terms for smooth transitions
  - Glossary panels are narrower than story layer 2 panels (45% vs 55%) for clear visual hierarchy
  - Back button added to glossary panel header for easy dismissal, matching story panel design
- **Theme fallback system**: Multi-tier protection against theme configuration errors
  - Three types of error detection: missing theme, malformed YAML, or critical system failure
  - Automatic fallback to paisajes (default) theme when configured theme is unavailable
  - Protected fallback copy in `scripts/defaults/themes/` as ultimate backup
  - Hardcoded CSS defaults ensure site functions even if all theme files are damaged
  - User-friendly warning messages on index page explain issues and suggest fixes

### Removed

- **Deprecated glossary CSV workflow**: Glossary feature now sources content exclusively from markdown files in `_glossary/`. CSV-based glossary input has been removed.
- **Non-functional project.csv fields**: Removed `primary_color`, `secondary_color`, `font_headings`, and `font_body` from `project.csv` (these values were not being used by templates). Theme customization now handled via the new theme system in `_data/themes/`.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2025-10-20

### Changed

- **Scrolling system overhaul**: Replaced Scrollama library with custom discrete step-based card stacking architecture to enable **multiple IIIF objects within a single story**. Each object gets its own preloaded viewer card that slides up/down as users navigate through steps.
- **Animation timing**: Reduced viewer pan/zoom animation duration from 36 seconds to 4 seconds for more natural pacing
- **Cleaner viewer UI**: Hidden UniversalViewer color picker and adjustment panels for distraction-free viewing

### Fixed

- **Critical navigation bug**: Fixed viewer cards getting stuck or invisible after backwardâ†’forward navigation cycles
- **Z-index layering**: Resolved issue where reused viewer cards appeared behind currently visible cards
- **State management**: Added complete state reset when reusing viewer cards (clears inline styles, transitions, opacity)
- **Intro handling**: Improved viewer reference management when navigating to/from story intro

### Added

- **Story 2 showcase**: Added comprehensive demo story with rich media examples (images, videos, markdown formatting)
- **Enhanced logging**: Improved console debugging messages for bounds checking and state transitions

## [0.1.1-beta] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- Fixed IIIF thumbnails loading at low resolution on home and objects pages by extracting 400px canvas images instead of tiny thumbnail properties
- Fixed markdown syntax not rendering in panels by adding markdown-to-HTML conversion in csv_to_json.py script
- Added comprehensive footnote styling for both panel layers with proper contrast and visual hierarchy
- Added markdown module to requirements.txt for GitHub Actions CI/CD compatibility
- Fixed image URLs in slide-over panels not working when site is deployed to subdirectories by automatically detecting and prepending the base URL
