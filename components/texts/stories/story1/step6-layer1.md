title: Seeing beyond the spectral: Ultraviolet and Hyperspectral analysis
---

Ultraviolet (UV) light analysis can reveal features of a khipu invisible in normal lighting, but what hidden stories emerge when we look beyond what our eyes can see? Hyperspectral analysis of a 16th-century khipu allows one to potentially detect subtle variations in dyes, fibers, and residues that are invisible to the naked eye. This non-invasive method provides new insights into the artifactâ€™s materials, construction, and use, deepening understanding of its historical and cultural significance. See what we learned when performing this analysis.
