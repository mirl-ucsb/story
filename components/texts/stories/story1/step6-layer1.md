title: Technical Imaging

Under UV, certain dyes, fibers, and residues fluoresce, exposing wear, repairs, or materials undetectable to the naked eye. This non-invasive method helps distinguish original components from later additions, offering clues to the khipu’s age, use, and history while safeguarding this fragile Andean artifact. The human eye perceives only a visible spectrum of approximately 380 to 1000 nanometers in wavelength. What more can one uncover if we could see beyond these limits? Hyperspectral imaging records data across narrow spectral bands, extending into ultraviolet and infrared ranges invisible to us. Applied to a khipu, it can reveal minute dye variations, fiber types, surface residues, and signs of repair, yielding precise, non-invasive insights into its materials, construction, and cultural history. Performing these two forms of technical analysis on this Khipu, however, offered little insight beyond what is initially observable. Here, we offer two Hyperspectral images: one at 380 nanometers, and one at 1000 nanometers. What do you see?
