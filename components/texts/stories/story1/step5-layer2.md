A sample was taken from the end of the primary cord, opposite the kayte knot. (A reminder this khipu is mounted backwards). This sample's radiocarbon age was 350 ±20 BP - calibrating the C14 age with the radiocarbon curve for South America provides the range of 1502-1643 (95% confidence)

A sample was taken from a pendant cord that is part of a cluster of dark brown cotton cords. This sample's radiocarbon age was 350 ±20 BP - calibrating the radiocarbon age with the C14 curve for South America gives us the range of 1502-1643 (95% confidence)

Both samples yielded the same date. Radiocarbon dating determines the measurement of carbon-14, radioactive isotope of carbon in organisms. All living organisms absorb carbon-14 until death, when it begins to decay at a constant rate. Scientists can measure the amount of radiocarbon in an organism from a very small sample of that organism – in the case of the khipu we removed 5 mg of cotton for samples -  and then use a calibration curve to determine what calendar year range it dates to. Radiocarbon calibration curves, there is one for the northern hemisphere and another for the southern hemisphere are developed from known ages – tree rings have been an important source for developing calibration curves as most trees attain a tree ring every year of their life, allowing for the determination of the tree’s age along with the amount of radiocarbon. This information is compiled to create calibration curves, offering a range of years in which the sample may date to.
