title: Understanding cords and their materiality
---
**Primary cord**: The primary cord contains minimal knots, aside from the kayte knot. Hanging from the primary cords are pendant cords, which can be "read" by counting the knots on each cord. Reading from left to right, this knot indicates the "beginning” of the khipu, and might also tell us something about the subject matter recorded by the khipu. 

**Pendant cord**: Hanging from the primary cord are pendant cords. Often pendant cords have additional cords attached to them called subsidiary cords. 

**Clusters**: Cord clusters are recognized based on gaps between cords on the primary cord.

**Materials in Khipus**: Khipu from the late Inka and early colonial era are made of natural materials, including natural fibers, like cotton, and natural dyes. These dyes are sourced from roots, minerals, and other plant life in the Andes. Another unique material sometimes found in khipus are human hair. Within many Andean cultural traditions, hair holds a symbolic importance. Recent research suggests the presence of hair in khipu cords is likely from the khipukamaoq, or maker of the khipu and, or individuals connected to the information in the khipu.
