title: How do we read a khipu? 
---

Today we are accustomed to written words, numbers, and books to share stories, accounting, and census information. To understand khipus, we need to first familiarize ourselves with its different cordage features. Khipus are made with natural materials most often fibers, such as cotton or camelid wool. Interact with the image to learn more about its main features, cord and knot types. Information coding in khipus begins with the construction of the cords.
