title: Interpreting the Khipu Cont'd
---
**Materials in Khipus**: Khipu from the late Inka and early colonial era are made of natural materials, including natural fibers, like cotton, and natural dyes. These dyes are sourced from roots, minerals, and other plant life in the Andes. Another unique material sometimes found in khipus are human hair. Within many Andean cultural traditions, hair holds a symbolic importance. Recent research suggests the presence of hair in khipu cords is likely from the khipukamaoq, or maker of the khipu and, or individuals connected to the information in the khipu.
