title: Khipu studies
---
Khipus are made of cordage, rope created from natural fibers, such as cotton, wool, among others. Cloth and textiles were of the utmost value to Andean peoples. Weaving is both one of the earliest art forms and subsistence practice in which Andean peoples expressed ideas, values, and identities in their world. Khipus are not cloth but the role of the khipu as recordkeeper, a story told with fibers, highlights how this practice is very embedded in fiber arts.  

In the early 1900s researchers identified that Inka khipus used a base-10 number system. Modern researchers since the 1980s have made great strides in understanding khipus drawing on ethnographic information in Andean highland communities that have historic and modern khipus, study of Colonial documents and references to khipus, the archaeological record, and with an increasingly large corpus of known khipus data science is an increasingly valuable tool for khipu studies.  

In this project we undertook study of the khipu at UC Santa Barbara's Art, Design, and Architecture Museum to learn its object history and try to understand when and how it may have been used, as well as inform others about its existence. We have shared our information with the [Khipu Field Guide](https://khipufieldguide.com) which maintains an open access database of studied khipus across the world.
