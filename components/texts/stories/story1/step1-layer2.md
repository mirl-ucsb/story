historiography
In the early 1900s researchers identified that Inka khipus used a basis of 10. Modern researchers since the 1980s have made great strides in understanding khipus. This is the result of ethnographic studies in Andean highland communities that have historic and modern khipus, study of Colonial documents and references to khipus, the archaeological record, and now - with a large corpus of known khipus - data science is an increasingly valuable tool for khipu studies.

In this project we undertook study of the khipu to learn its object history and try to understand when and how it may have been used, as well as inform others about its existence. We have shared our information with the [Khipu Field Guide](https://khipufieldguide.com) which maintains an open access database of studied khipus across the world.
