Despite many years in the AD&A Museum's collection, the khipu had not formally been studied. In this project we undertook study of the khipu to learn its object history and try to understand when and how it may have been used - as well as inform others about its existence. We have shared our information with the [Khipu Field Guide](https://khipufieldguide.com) which maintains an open access database of studied khipus across the world. 

Goodspeed also collected ancient ceramic and textile objects that represented indigenous plant life in the Andes, such as the vessel pictured here. There is little available information about where Goodspeed acquired these objects. After Goodspeed’s death in 1966, his children donated their father’s entire collection to the newly formed “Art Galleries” at UCSB, contributing to the early development of the collection. Several years later, the Galleries became the Art, Design & Architecture Museum.
