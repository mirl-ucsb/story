Goodspeed also collected ancient ceramic and textile objects that represented Indigenous plant life in the Andes, such as the Nazca vessel pictured here. There is little available information about where Goodspeed acquired these objects. After Goodspeed’s death in 1966, his children donated their father’s entire collection to the newly formed “Art Galleries” at UCSB, contributing to the early development of the collection. Several years later, the Galleries became the [Art, Design & Architecture Museum](https://www.museum.ucsb.edu).
