title: Khipu Features, knots & counting
---

All three knot types are tied by wrapping loops around a finger. Single knots are created by looping a cord around the index finger, passing the running end of the cord through the loop, and then pulling the loop tight after it’s been removed from the finger. Long knots are made in a very similar fashion. The key difference is that multiple loops would be wrapped around the finger in the first step, rather than only a single loop. The number of loops corresponds to the numerical value of the long knot. The figure eight knot once again begins with a loop around the index finger, but this time, the second loop is created by crossing the running end back over the first loop instead of wrapping it beside the first loop as would be done in a long knot. When the running end is passed through the first loop again, the two loops form a figure eight. Watch the videos below to learn more about different knot types on khipu and how they are created.

Counting the cords on a khipu means looking at knot types as well as where the knots are placed on a cords. The upper section of a khipu cord contains only single knots, which represent values in multiples of 10. The lower section of the cord consists of figure eight and long knots. Figure eight knots denote a value of 1, and long knots denote values 2 through 9. The values in the upper and lower registers on a cord are added together to get the value of the cord as a whole. For example, this cord from the UCSB khipu can be read as having a value of 44 since it has 4 single knots in the upper register and a 4 long knot in the lower register.

## Spin direction and Ply


Based on the direction they are plied, cords have an S or Z spin.The spin direction and ply of the cords can denote additional meaning to what is encoded on each cord through knots and placement. Cords are created by first spinning the fiber in one direction to create a single strand. Next, 2+ single strands are wrapped, or “plied,” together in the opposite direction to form the finished cord. Using 2 singles is most common, but more than 2 can be plied together, as is the case with the 3-ply primary cord on the khipu at UCSB. Khipu cords can either be classified as having an S or Z ply. An S-plied cord is made of single strands that are spun clockwise (Z-spun). The Z-spun singles are then plied counterclockwise to create the S-plied cord. The inverse is true of Z-plied cords.
