title: Interpreting the Khipu
---

Analysis of the khipu at UCSB identified **97 pendant cords** and **37 subsidiary cords** in **nine clusters**. These nine clusters of cords likely recorded census and tribute information related to different communities, which is suggested by the patterning on the cords within each cluster.

Looking closely, some of the clusters contain many knots and knot types, while the cords in other clusters have fewer knots, or none at all. This speaks to the continual use and re-use of khipu to record and update information.

Taking a closer look at Cluster 10, we can see that pendant cords within a cluster tend to share characteristics. These 8 pendant cords are all the same shade of dark brown with similar knot construction; their knots are all tied 10 to 12.3 cm from their respective attachments to the primary cord, and their knot values range from 1 to 4. Both of these ranges are small relative to the wider set of ranges within the rest of the khipu. While there are slight differences from cord to cord, these cords are more similar to each other than they are to cords of other clusters, and the same can be said of every cluster on the khipu. Some clusters are more uniform than others, but all clusters are made up of generally similar cords.
