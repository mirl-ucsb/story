title: Khipu Features, knots & counting
---

The attachment and organization of the pendant cords of the khipu on the primary, or main cord, is intentional and organized. 20th and 21st century oral histories from Andean highland community members indicate how. These accounts tell us that the different clusters of knots and the variation of colored cords is a means to record the contributions of specific allyu, or communities in a certain area. There is also likely significance of the different colors of cordage, including the multi-colored, or mottled cords. Watch the videos below to learn more about different knot types on khipu and how they are created.

[**Add VIDEOS**] All three knot types are tied by wrapping loops around a finger. Single knots are created by looping a cord around the index finger, passing the running end of the cord through the loop, and then pulling the loop tight after it’s been removed from the finger. Long knots are made in a very similar fashion. The key difference is that multiple loops would be wrapped around the finger in the first step, rather than only a single loop. The number of loops corresponds to the numerical value of the long knot. The figure eight knot once again begins with a loop around the index finger, but this time, the second loop is created by crossing the running end back over the first loop instead of wrapping it beside the first loop as would be done in a long knot. When the running end is passed through the first loop again, the two loops form a figure eight.

The upper section of a khipu cord contains only single knots, which represent values in multiples of 10. The lower section of the cord consists of figure eight and long knots. Figure eight knots denote a value of 1, and long knots denote values 2 through 9. The values in the upper and lower registers on a cord are added together to get the value of the cord as a whole. For example, this cord from the UCSB khipu can be read as having a value of 44 since it has 4 single knots in the upper register and a 4 long knot in the lower register. 


## Materials and More

**Materials in Khipus**: Khipu from the late Inka and early colonial era are made of natural materials, including natural fibers, like cotton, and natural dyes. These dyes are sourced from roots, minerals, and other plant life in the Andes. Another unique material sometimes found in this khipu is human hair. Within many Andean cultural traditions, hair holds a symbolic importance. According to new research in anthropology, the presence of hair in khipu cords is likely from the khipukamaoq, or maker of the khipu and, or individuals connected to the information in the khipu.

**Spin direction and Ply**: Spin direction and Ply: Based on the direction they are plied, cords have an S or Z spin.The spin direction and ply of the cords can denote additional meaning to what is encoded on each cord through knots and placement. Cords are created by first spinning the material–often cotton or wool–in one direction to create a single strand. Next, 2+ single strands are wrapped, or “plied,” together in the opposite direction to form the finished cord. Using 2 singles is most common, but more than 2 can be plied together, as is the case with the 3-ply primary cord on the khipu at UCSB. Khipu cords can either be classified as having an S or Z ply. An S-plied cord is made of single strands that are spun clockwise (Z-spun). The Z-spun singles are then plied counterclockwise to create the S-plied cord. The inverse is true of Z-plied cords.
