title: When you see this khipu (key-pu) what do you notice? What can we learned from it?
---

Take a close look at this khipu (key-pu), now in the AD&A Museum at UC Santa Barbara. At first glance, this khipu may appear to be a tangled grouping of fiber cords yet it is a recording device made of fibers and knots used by the people of South America. Analysis of the khipu, its materials, organization of cords, knots, and technical studies such as radiocarbon dating tells us about the information contained in this khipu, this khipuâ€™s story and how it served Andean peoples. (mention all the types of analysis, which the reader will learn more about in other part of the exhibition)
