title: Khipu Provenance 
---

The khipu was collected by Dr. Thomas Harper Goodspeed, a botanist at UC Berkeley, who undertook six scientific expeditions to Peru & Chile in the 1930s and ‘40s. The expeditions were part of Goodspeed’s research on indigenous plants from Peru. Goodspeed likely acquired the khipu and other parts of his collection during an expedition.

Goodspeed’s scientific work intersected with U.S. diplomatic and commercial interests; he represented the Committee on Interamerican Artistic and Cultural Relations, led by Nelson Rockefeller, and was involved in organizations promoting large-scale tobacco hybridization. While in Peru, he met archaeologists Julio Tello and Luis Valcárcel, and possibly participated in excavations, revealing his broader interest and professional networks related to the study of ancient Andean cultures.
