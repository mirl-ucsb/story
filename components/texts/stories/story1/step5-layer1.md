title: Studying a Khipu - Carbon Dating Technical Analysis
---

Radiocarbon dating informs us that this khipu was in use between 1502-1643, a period of time that encompasses both the Inca empire and the early colonial period.  We took small samples of about 5 mg from two cords, the primary cord and a pendant cord for radiocarbon dating. See where we took the samples from in the photo.
