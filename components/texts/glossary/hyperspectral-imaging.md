Hyperspectral imaging is a non-invasive analytical technique that captures reflectance data across dozens or hundreds of narrow spectral bands, far beyond the range of human vision. Instead of a single photograph, it produces a three-dimensional “data cube” that maps how an object interacts with light at each wavelength. This allows researchers to identify materials, dyes, and surface features on khipus that may be invisible to the naked eye.
