Carbon dating, also known as radiocarbon dating, is a scientific method used to determine the age of organic materials by measuring the decay of the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Because carbon-14 decreases at a known rate over time, the remaining amount in a sample can be used to estimate when the organism last lived. For khipus, carbon dating helps establish when the fibers were produced, providing a chronological framework for understanding their historical context.
