Primary cord refers to the main horizontal cord of a khipu from which all pendant and subsidiary cords are suspended. It serves as the structural backbone of the device, organizing the overall layout and hierarchy of information. Its length, thickness, twist direction, and attachment style often hold interpretive significance for understanding how a khipu was made and used.
