Knot typology refers to the classification system used to identify and interpret the different types of knots found on a khipu. These knots, such as single, long (multiple overhand), and figure-eight knots, encode numerical values or categorical information depending on their form and placement. Studying knot typology helps researchers understand how information was structured, recorded, and communicated within Andean recordkeeping systems.
