Pendant cord is a vertical cord attached to the primary cord of a khipu, forming the main units through which information is encoded. These cords typically contain knots, colors, or fiber variations that convey numerical or categorical data. Their number, spacing, and arrangement play a central role in interpreting the structure and meaning of a khipu.
